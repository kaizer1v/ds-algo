# ds-algo

Data Structures &amp; Algorithms using Python

## But WHY?

This repository is structured in a way to help you understand and implement **computational thinking**. This will help you solve problems a little more effectively.

> The most essential tool kit for anyone writing software. Also just for kicks.

What does this repository contain?

## 1. Data Structures

> If you are knight, data structures are your swords and weapons. If you are a football player, data strucutres are your shoes. If you are a chef, data structures are your raw ingredients.

* What a data structure is designed to do
* What are the drawbacks of a data structure
* How can it be improved


## 2. Algorithms

> If you are knight, algorithms are your fighting skills using your swords and weapons. If you are football player, algorithms are your dribbling skills wearing those shoes. If you are a chef, algorithms are your mixology skills using your raw ingredients.

BUT - Efficiency is of the essence for a computer person - not how well you fight or how good you can dribble or how good your food tastes. What matters is how fast and efficiently your program runs.

* How an algorithm uses a data strucuture
* Why is one algorithm faster than the other

## 3. Exercises

A bunch of experiments that uses data structures and algorithms to solve problems.


## 4. Test Cases (Optional)

A bunch of test cases are written here to help write better code. It's a great way to say if something works as intended.

All of the code written is documented using the pydoc standards. Every `function`, `class` and `file` is documented to help understand better.
